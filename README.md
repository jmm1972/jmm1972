Hi, I am Jorge M. Mendes.

I have been a university professor and researcher for more than 25 years.

My background is in Probability and Statistics, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

I am an Associate Professor at the NOVA Information Management School of the NOVA
University Lisbon, Portugal. Currently, I am currently serving as the Information Management Programme Liaison Director at NOVA University Lisbon Cairo Branch at The Knowledge Hub of Universities (TKH), Egypt.
I am deeply committed to addressing the pressing need for skilled human resources 
in these fields here in Egypt.

My main areas of research are in biostatistics and mathematical epidemiology. However,
occasionally, I make some incursions through fields that somehow I fall in love with.
That's why this repository is devoted to this package that I started developing some months ago.
I fell in love with Partial Least Squares, its simplicity and elegance, and I decided to
contribute to the development of the field.

This is my first project publicly available on github, but many others are to come, as my
main area of work is the development of new methodology.

If you want to contact me, please do so through the email jmm@novaims.unl.pt

I hope you enjoy!
